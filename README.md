[Cleared all relevant content including Kil'jaeden](https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-gb/character/eu/tarren-mill/lancedrake/achievements/dungeons-raids/the-burning-crusade).

### WOTLK
Several [Feaths of strength](https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-gb/character/eu/tarren-mill/lancedrake/achievements/feats-of-strength/raids) in WOTLK
of particular note realm first! Yogg 0 lights & a tribute to immortality.

### Cataclysm
I did not raid much in Cataclysm my PC at the time could no longer keep up.
I did return and defeat Firelands and Deathwing as a social / pugging at the tail end of the expansion.

### MOP
I did not participate in MOP in any meaningful way.

### WOD
[Cutting Edge: Imperator:](https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-gb/character/eu/tarren-mill/lancedrake/achievements/feats-of-strength/raids)
I almost got to progress on Blackhand mythic but sadly the guild disbanded and I lost the motivation to keep going.
Never got to do Hellfire Citadel beyond pugging heroic when preparing for Legion.
I did get to do [challenge modes](https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-gb/character/eu/tarren-mill/lancedrake/achievements/legacy/dungeons) without the cheesey strats/trinkets.. Though only because we didn't have access to those items.

### Legion
Led my own [guild](https://www.warcraftlogs.com/character/eu/the-maelstrom/lancelol?zone=10) up through The Nighthold.
Did get cutting edge from [Tomb Of Sargeras](https://www.warcraftlogs.com/character/eu/tarren-mill/lanceqt?zone=17#zone=13)
almost cleared [Antorus, The Burning Throne](https://www.warcraftlogs.com/character/eu/tarren-mill/lanceqt?zone=17#) but sadly the guild disbanned and as is my tradition at this point i lose motivation when that happens.
I also did decent in [M+](https://raider.io/characters/eu/tarren-mill/Lanceqt#season=season-7.3.2)

### BFA
Cleared the first tier on two characters [death knight](https://www.warcraftlogs.com/character/eu/tarren-mill/lanceqt?zone=24#zone=19) and [monk](https://www.warcraftlogs.com/character/eu/tarren-mill/littlelance?zone=24#zone=19) oh and kinda also on [warrior](https://www.warcraftlogs.com/character/eu/tarren-mill/lanceblast?zone=24#zone=19) guild disbanned I tried to merge the two guilds I was raiding in and it worked for a time, but ended up disbanning anyway.

### Shadowlands
didn't participate in any meaningful way.

### Dragonflight

Only recently started playing again, the game is great and I really wanna get back into mythic raiding currently I have just cleared heroic and I have mostly done [mythic+](https://raider.io/characters/eu/tarren-mill/Lancedrake)
I have picked up [Evoker](https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-gb/character/eu/tarren-mill/lancedrake) which I have been enjoying greatly!
I can play both healer and DPS ([logs](https://www.warcraftlogs.com/character/eu/tarren-mill/lancedrake)) but I prefer DPS in raids.

I am also working on a priest & druid as alts especially for M+.

## About me.

Now that we got the practical information out of the way here is some information about me.
I am 34 & from Denmark as my history shows above I have been playing MMOs on and off for the past 15 or so years.
Other then playing games I enjoy all things tech and an somewhat verced in software development I generally like to be creative.

I like to push myself and always want to do better in the things I care about be that my wow performance or coding or anything else that catches my intrest.
I stream most of my raiding [here](https://www.twitch.tv/lanc3qt)
