## Retail History
### TBC
[Cleared all relevant content, including Kil'jaeden.](https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-gb/character/eu/tarren-mill/lancedrake/achievements/dungeons-raids/the-burning-crusade)

### WOTLK
I earned several [Feats of Strength](https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-gb/character/eu/tarren-mill/lancedrake/achievements/feats-of-strength/raids) in WOTLK, notably, the realm first! Yogg 0 lights & A Tribute to Immortality.

### Cataclysm
I didn't raid much in Cataclysm as my PC at the time couldn't keep up. I did return and defeat Firelands and Deathwing as a social/pug player towards the end of the expansion.

### MOP
I didn't participate in MOP in any meaningful way.

### WOD
I earned the [Cutting Edge: Imperator](https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-gb/character/eu/tarren-mill/lancedrake/achievements/feats-of-strength/raids) achievement. Almost got to progress on Blackhand mythic, but the guild sadly disbanded, and I lost motivation. I didn't get to do Hellfire Citadel beyond pugging heroic when preparing for Legion. However, I did complete [challenge modes](https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-gb/character/eu/tarren-mill/lancedrake/achievements/legacy/dungeons) without cheesy strategies or trinkets - only because we didn't have access to those items.

### Legion
I led my own [guild](https://www.warcraftlogs.com/character/eu/the-maelstrom/lancelol?zone=10) up through The Nighthold and earned Cutting Edge from the [Tomb Of Sargeras](https://www.warcraftlogs.com/character/eu/tarren-mill/lanceqt?zone=17#zone=13). Almost cleared [Antorus, The Burning Throne](https://www.warcraftlogs.com/character/eu/tarren-mill/lanceqt?zone=17#) but the guild disbanded, causing my motivation to drop. I also performed well in [M+](https://raider.io/characters/eu/tarren-mill/Lanceqt#season=season-7.3.2).

### BFA
I cleared the first tier on two characters, [Death Knight](https://www.warcraftlogs.com/character/eu/tarren-mill/lanceqt?zone=24#zone=19) and [Monk](https://www.warcraftlogs.com/character/eu/tarren-mill/littlelance?zone=24#zone=19), and somewhat on my [Warrior](https://www.warcraftlogs.com/character/eu/tarren-mill/lanceblast?zone=24#zone=19). After my guild disbanded, I tried merging two raiding guilds, which worked for a while but ended up disbanding anyway.

### Shadowlands
I didn't participate in any meaningful way.

### Dragonflight
I've recently started playing again and am thoroughly enjoying the game. I'm eager to get back into mythic raiding. So far, I have just cleared heroic and mostly done [mythic+](https://raider.io/characters/eu/tarren-mill/Lancedrake). I've picked up [Evoker](https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-gb/character/eu/tarren-mill/lancedrake), which I have been greatly enjoying! I can play both healer and DPS ([logs](https://www.warcraftlogs.com/character/eu/tarren-mill/lancedrake)), but I prefer DPS in raids.
Pugged the first two bosses in mythic and cleared HC.

I am also working on a Priest and Druid as alts, primarily for M+.

## Classic Experience 
I completed all the content as it was relevant in [TBC](https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/character/eu/mirage-raceway/lanceqt?zone=1013#zone=1011) & [WOTLK](https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/character/eu/golemagg/lancedots).

## Other MMOs
The only notable achievements I can mention here are that I have cleared a savage [tier](https://www.fflogs.com/character/eu/cerberus/lance%20qt#zone=49) in FFIXV, and a tier in [Wildstar](https://www.wildstarlogs.com/character/eu/jabbit/lancelol%20betasword?zone=2#zone=1).

## Schedule
I can raid on Thursday, Friday, Monday, and Tuesday. Almost any time of day works for me. On Wednesday and Sunday, I raid in classic, and on Saturday, I host a [podcast](https://www.youtube.com/@TheDresdenFilesPodcastShow).

## About Me
Now that we've covered the practical information, here's a bit about me. I'm 34 and from Denmark. As my history shows, I have been playing MMOs on and off for the past 15 or so years. Apart from playing games, I'm a tech enthusiast, somewhat versed in software development, and I generally enjoy being creative.

I like to challenge myself and always strive to do better in the things I care about, be it my WoW performance, coding, or anything else that piques my interest. I stream most of my raiding [here](https://www.twitch.tv/lanc3qt).
